# Docker compose example
This is a simple example of how to use Gradio with Docker compose to help you get started on the project.  
The ```annoy-api``` and ```Dockefile-api``` files shows how to putt an Annoy index in a Docker container and expose it as a REST API.  
The ```Dockerfile-gradio``` and the ```gradio-webapp``` files show how to put a Gradio webapp in a Docker container.
You could easily start from this example to build your recommender system.  
In the ```gradio-webapp``` I generate a random vector to show how to use the API. You can replace it with your own vector, computed by your model.  
In the ```annoy-api``` I use a fake index to show how to use the API. You can replace it with your own index, computed by your model and return as many results as you want.
